# Qwen3-TTS on the RTX 5090 Decode Megakernel

[AlpinDale's qwen_megakernel](https://github.com/AlpinDale/qwen_megakernel) (single
persistent CUDA kernel decoding Qwen3-0.6B at ~1000 tok/s on an RTX 5090) repurposed
as the **talker decoder** of [Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice),
streaming real-time speech.

## Results (RTX 5090, bf16)

| Metric | Value | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Talker decode rate | **1018 tok/s** (0.98 ms/step) | ~1000 (blog) |
| TTFC (time to first audio chunk) | **~89 ms** | < 90 ms |
| RTF (wall / audio duration) | **~0.18** | < 0.3 |
| Streaming | chunk-by-chunk, ~1 s chunks, 333 ms first chunk | required |

Per-iteration cost breakdown (one 12 Hz codec frame):

| Component | ms |
|---|---|
| Talker megakernel step (28 layers) | 0.79 |
| Codec-head logits + top-k sample | 0.02 |
| Code predictor, 15 codebooks (CUDA graph) | 10.75 |
| 12 Hz codec decode (amortized, 17.9 ms / 12 frames) | ~1.5 |

The megakernel is **not** the bottleneck — the 5-layer code predictor (15 sequential
sub-steps per frame, vendored from
[faster-qwen3-tts](https://github.com/andimarafioti/faster-qwen3-tts) as a CUDA graph)
dominates at ~81% of step time.

### vs. stock qwen_tts (same weights, text, speaker, seed)

| | Stock `qwen_tts` | Megakernel engine |
|---|---|---|
| RTF | 1.048 (slower than real time) | **0.187** (5.6× faster) |
| Decode throughput | 11.5 frames/s | ~64 frames/s |
| Time to first audio | 6.3–7.8 s (no streaming) | **90 ms** |

Reproduce with `python3 tests/bench_vs_baseline.py` (writes `cmp_stock.wav` /
`cmp_megakernel.wav` for a listening comparison).

## Why almost no kernel changes were needed

The 0.6B talker backbone is **dimensionally identical** to Qwen3-0.6B: hidden 1024,
intermediate 3072, 28 layers, 16 Q / 8 KV heads, head_dim 128, RMS eps 1e-6. The real
differences are handled outside the kernel:

| Difference | Where handled |
|---|---|
| `rope_theta` 1e6 (vs 1e4) | cos/sin tables rebuilt in Python (`talker_megakernel.py`) |
| Interleaved M-RoPE `[24,20,20]` | reduces *exactly* to standard rotate-half RoPE during decode because all 3 position streams are equal (verified numerically); kernel RoPE used as-is |
| Inputs are embeddings, not token ids (codec-embedding sums + projected text hiddens) | kernel reads `embed_weight + token_id*H`; we pass a 1-row staging buffer + `token_id=0` |
| Codec head: 3072-entry vocab, untied | `LDG_VOCAB_SIZE` made a compile-time macro (the only kernel source change for adaptation); top-k sampling via a trivial torch matvec on the kernel's final-norm output |
| Variable-length prompt prefill | one HF forward; its DynamicCache (post-RoPE K) is copied into the kernel's `[layer, kv_head, pos, head_dim]` cache layout |

## Kernel bug found & fixed: entry-barrier race → deadlock

`ldg_decode_kernel_direct` reset its grid-barrier words (`barrier_counter`,
`barrier_sense`) from *inside* the kernel (block 0), racing against other blocks
already arriving at the entry barrier. If block 0's reset of `barrier_sense` landed
after another block had published `sense=1`, late blocks spun on `sense==0` forever.
Back-to-back identical launches (the upstream benchmark pattern) rarely trigger it,
but interleaving CUDA-graph replays and memsets between launches (our decode loop)
skews block start times and deadlocked reliably within a few steps.

Fix: zero the barrier/flag words with stream-ordered `cudaMemsetAsync` on the host
before each launch and drop the in-kernel reset *and* the entry barrier entirely
(the first `grid.sync()` with `local_gen=0` is the rendezvous). This also shaves a
few µs per step. See `csrc/kernel.cu` (`launch_ldg_decode_direct`).

## Numerical parity

Compared against the HF talker (sdpa) on identical prefill + inputs:
- per-layer outputs match to bf16 noise (layer-0 maxdiff 0.003);
- after 28 layers, hidden-state cosine ≈ 0.98 — **tighter than HF's own
  sdpa-vs-eager noise floor (cosine 0.952)** on the same step;
- top-5 codec logits are the same set. Under temperature-0.9 top-k sampling this is
  numerically equivalent. (`tests/test_parity.py`, `tests/debug_prefill.py`)

## Run

```bash
# requires: RTX 5090 (sm_120), CUDA 12.8+, torch with sm_120 support
# pip install -r requirements.txt && bash scripts/fix_torchaudio_stub.sh
python3 synthesize.py "Hello from the megakernel." --speaker ryan --out hello.wav

# streaming API
python3 - <<'PY'
from qwen_tts_megakernel.engine import MegakernelTTS
eng = MegakernelTTS()
for audio, sr, timing in eng.stream("Streaming speech!", speaker="ryan", language="English"):
    ...  # play / forward each float32 chunk as it arrives
PY

# tests & benchmarks
python3 tests/test_parity.py   # numerical parity vs HF
python3 tests/test_e2e.py      # end-to-end wav + HF baseline comparison
python3 tests/bench.py         # tok/s, component costs, TTFC, RTF
```

Note: in this container the stock `torchaudio` wheel is ABI-incompatible with the
NVIDIA torch build; a stub satisfying `qwen_tts`'s unused 25Hz-tokenizer import is
installed instead (the 12Hz path never calls it). If anything fails to start with
`OSError: libtorchaudio.abi3.so: undefined symbol: ...`, a pip install has pulled
the real torchaudio back in — run `bash scripts/fix_torchaudio_stub.sh` to fix.

## Honest limitations / next steps

- The code predictor (10.8 ms/frame) is the obvious optimization target — a second
  megakernel or a leaner handwritten loop could plausibly take RTF from 0.18 to <0.05.
- Greedy argmax from the kernel's fused LM head is available "for free" but unused;
  TTS quality needs top-k sampling (done in torch, 0.02 ms).
- Batch size 1 only, single utterance at a time (matches the megakernel's design).
- `max_seq_len` 4096 (≈5.5 min of audio incl. prompt) — KV cache is preallocated.
